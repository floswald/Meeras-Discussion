# Overview and Findings of the Paper

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Electricity is a core input both in developing and developed economies.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2. Electricity in India is supplied very unreliably, severly curtailing economic growth.
:::

. . .

### This Paper

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Uses the staggered introduction of a large reform of the electricity generation and distribution market (all state-owned (?)) to identify effects of different reform types. State of the art DiD and event study methodology employed. üëè
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2.  Finds that states who unified distribution network increased electricity reliability. Both prices and consumption increase - high WTP of firms for more reliable electricity!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Findings

::: fragment
- Increased competition in power distribution does not unequivocally lead to more stable supply and lower prices. Context matters.  
:::

::: fragment
-   Electricity price increased significantly with single distributor.
:::

::: fragment
-   The probability of using a generator increases significantly *as well* in single distributor states. 
:::

::: fragment
-   Days worked and total output increase markedly in single distributor states, suggesting that firms are able to scale up operations significantly on the back of stable baseline supply.
:::


# Comments

I have three short comments.

## Comment 1: Pre-trend in Light Density?

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=40%}
* Is the black line trending up?
* Does it matter?
* What does it mean? (What's the unit on y-axis?)

:::

* ü§î I'm often unsure of what the relevant control group is in settings like this, so please point out.

## Comment 2: Suggesting some clarifying edits

<br>

1. Why exactly is electricity unreliable? Problem of generators, or distributors, or both? Clearly spelling out the details would help the reader understand the issues at hand.

<br>

2. Table 1: *220 manufacturing days on average.* 5 days x 48 weeks would be 240 days. Why so few days? I guess unstable power supply is a reason, and indeed part of the story, so some highlighting of this in the text would be good.

----


## Comment 3: What Do We Recommend To Do?


* What is the relationship between large scale infrastructure investments (i.e. big up-front expenditures) and the flow of revenue from consumers when it comes to assuring stable electricity supply? 

. . .


* Couldn't the central government make a big investment into upgrading existing infrastructure with debt financing (say), and rely on consumer subscriptions to pay for (smaller) operating costs?


. . .

* There is a link to other network-based utilities like rail (UK and France, for instance), where central government did the bulk of large initial investment.

# This time is different? Irrigation in France 1700-1860.

@rosenthal, *The Development of Irrigation in Provence, 1700-1860: The French Revolution and Economic Growth.*

-------------------------


## Irrigation channels in 18-th century France

::: {.fragment}

* @rosenthal shows that France throughout 1700-1860 had insufficient irrigation the *Provence* region, holding back growth (main sector: agriculture). TFP loss of up to 40%.

:::

::: {.fragment}

* Resulting growth problem similar to @fried, just substitute `water` for `electricity`.

:::

::: {.fragment}

* Technology and credit were available to private entrepreneurs.

:::

::: {.fragment}

* Many canal projects failed because of *rent extraction downstream along the distribution network*.

:::

::: {.fragment}

* Only after the **French Revolution** this problem disappeared.

## Parallels to @rosenthal?

* Of course electricity market in India 2023 is significantly different from irrigation water distribution in France in 1700. So, yes, *this time is different* üòâ
* Both settings, however, highlight the detrimental role inefficient distribution of inputs has on productivity.
* Potential solutions in both settings have to do with *property rights*, or market segmentation in the widest sense. *More competition* will not work in both cases, without caveats.
* In India it seems to be crucial to allow a distributor to reach a certain size in order to be efficient. In Provence the French Revolution meant that right-of-way was completely centralized, to the benefit of infrastructure projects.

Thanks for this nice paper!
